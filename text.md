Having acquired a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science followed by close to eight years working as a full stack Software Developer, I have navigated the depths of software engineering and other contemporary tools. In particular, I have had some hands-on experience on technologies like Python web frameworks namely: Django, Flask, asp.net, FastAPI or even Laravel in addition to installing Tailwind CSS, Next js, React, React Native and so on. In addition, I am also proficient in not only the frontend or backend areas, but also related to the application deployment in various environments and using docker, kubernetes, jenkins, nginx and also using aws or google, azure clouds and so on. Such expedience allowed me to create, launch and maintain systems of considerable sizes within a decent timeframe.
Apart from full stack development, I have come to develop interest in data science and machine learning as I found myself engaged on some projects which required data driven decisions. This exposure to AI systems has inspired me to get deeper into some interests such as complex systems and algorithms, deep learning technology including its practical uses in transforming the universe. It is for this reason that I am looking to take a Master’s program in Artificial Intelligence Technology because I will be able to cover more of these technologies and their uses more extensively and these are key to my objectives.
The MSc degree course is perfect for me as I will be able to look into the emerging scholarship pertaining to radical AI concepts and upgrade my technology skills. One specific example I would like to expand upon is studying machine learning more deeply in particular its advanced applications such as for instance neural networks, natural language processing, autonomous systems and applying that to building AI systems.



As a full-stack engineer with several years of experience in software development and a hands-on practicals in DevOps, the driving force has always been an enthusiasm for solving complex problems by applying technology. My introduction to Applied Data science  Lab from WorldQuant University and Microsoft Azure AI Associate Engineer course trigged in me a passion for artificial intelligence, so now I want to build expertise within this domain for a transformational impact. For this reason, I believe an M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence at Northumbria University will afford me the best chance to transition from the current position of my knowledge to the advanced levels of AI advancements.

I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science; here I stood my ground on algorithms, data structures, and programming. My interest in machine learning developed while working on projects related to predictive analytics and Azure AI Document Intelligence hence experiences thus provided a theoretical grounding that constitutes a proper pursuit of advanced AI concepts.

As a full-stack engineer, I have led the development of robust web applications by working across technologies such as React, React Native, Django, Typescript, JavaScript and Laravel. My experience in DevOps, including containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes, ultimately enhanced my ability to deploy scalable and efficient systems. Throughout my career, with increasing frequency, I apply data science techniques to build predictive models, and I have worked on projects involving recommendation systems and sentiment analysis. Hearing how and where AI solutions are used has inspired me towards gaining more in-depth knowledge on it.

That is why I am interested in the MSc Artificial Intelligence program offered by Northumbria University as well as the fact that it contains theoretical information about AI and its practical application. In particular, it is the deep learning, AI ethics, and autonomous systems focus at this program that inspires me. I look forward to attending the AI research group at the university and working with reputable researchers such as Dr. Jane Doe, whose work on AI in healthcare is so inspiring. Hence, at Northumbria, industrial links and their applied approach to learning will enable me to acquire advanced skills necessary to participate effectively in AI driven innovation.

After M.Sc completion in AI, I hope to be employed in companies as a Machine Learning Engineer working on various projects applying AI for real-life problem solving, particularly in healthcare and finance. In the long run I see myself leading AI research initiatives that would extend the area of recursion that AI is trying to make life easier for the human being.

Since having prior work experience in software development and devotion for DevOps, I am sure that pursuing MSc in AI in Northumbria University will be the right opportunity to enrich my knowledge in the field. I am eagerly waiting to both offer my knowledge enhancing and sharing with other distinguished members of the university’s AI team & also looking forward to creating an impact of the future of AI.
